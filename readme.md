# ðŸŽµ Spotify Music Analysis & Genre Classification

This project explores the musical landscape of Spotify tracks using data science techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), supervised classification (multiclass & multilabel), and clustering.

The goal is to classify songs into meaningful genres based on their audio features, analyze explicit content influence on popularity, and discover hidden song clusters to aid music recommendation systems.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Research Questions

1. **Explicit Content Analysis**  
   _Does explicit content impact track popularity?_  
   â†’ Performed hypothesis testing (t-test) and EDA.

2. **Genre Classification**  
   _Can we classify songs into genres based on audio features?_  
   â†’ Implemented:
   - Multiclass classification (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Multilabel classification (one-vs-rest RF models)
   - Compared results using accuracy and F1 scores

3. **Clustering for Recommendation**  
   _Can we uncover natural groupings of songs using audio features?_  
   â†’ Used K-Means clustering with PCA visualization and silhouette analysis.
